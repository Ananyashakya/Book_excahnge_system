# Solar Panel Efficiency Simulator

A simulation-based tool to visualize solar panel energy output over a 24-hour period using SimPy and a frontend UI built with HTML and JavaScript. This project was designed to combine logic-driven simulation with data visualization for understanding solar efficiency trends.

# Features

- Discrete-event simulation of energy generation using SimPy
- Graph plots showing hourly energy output
- Custom frontend to visualize simulation results
- Educational focus on renewable energy and sustainability
- Adjustable conditions (sunlight duration, time range) *(extendable)*

# Technologies Used

- Python (SimPy)
- Matplotlib
- HTML
- JavaScript

# How to Run

1. Run the Python simulation file (with SimPy logic)
2. View the graph output (auto-generated using Matplotlib)
3. Open the HTML interface to visualize and interact with simulation *(optional)*

# Possible Improvements

- Connect backend and frontend using Flask
- Add user controls for adjusting panel conditions
- Export results to CSV or SQLite
